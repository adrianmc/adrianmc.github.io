  <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
  <p>I&#39;ve been listening to some podcasts, and today I&#39;m going to summarize a couple of them that I found to be particularly valuable. Peter Voogd has went on Hal Elrod&#39;s podcasts twice, and I listened to both of them.</p>

<p>The links to the podcasts are here: <a href="http://halelrod.com/36/">first</a>, <a href="http://halelrod.com/55-6-figures/">second</a>.</p>

<h1>1st Podcast: How to be a game changer</h1>

<p>HOW FAST CAN I IMPLEMENT THIS - this is very important</p>

<p>Start by asking about your ideal outcome:
- What is your vision for business, lifestyle, income in 6-12 months?</p>

<h1>1. Simplicity</h1>

<p>Simplify what really matters to you.</p>

<h2>One-page productivity plan - mastery over information overload</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>contents</p>

<ul>
<li>one paragraph vision statement

<ul>
<li>who I am, where I wanna be, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>top values

<ul>
<li>flexibility, financial freedom, wealth, family, adventure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>big 5 goals for the year

<ul>
<li>look at them and make sure they are in line with your values and they excite u</li>
</ul></li>
<li>key behaviour and habits required to accomplish the big 5</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>once u know what&#39;s important to you (see above), make sure the information you are studying is congruent to that</p></li>
<li><p>master 3 books than read 50</p>

<ul>
<li>it&#39;s not a race to finish a book</li>
<li>we want to see results in our lives and business</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>focus on mastering a certain topic rather than simply focusing on finishing a book</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let your vision guide you, not your current circumstances, emotions, feelings, challenges.</p>

<h2>2. Schedule everything - weekly review</h2>

<ul>
<li>our memory sucks</li>
<li><p>everything I want to accomplish for this week MUST be on paper</p>

<ul>
<li>what did I get done and complete last week? pause and reflect.

<ul>
<li>what did i complete</li>
<li>what went well, what didn&#39;t go so well</li>
<li>when did i waste time, when was i at my best</li>
<li>REVIEWING IS SO IMPORTANT</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>what are your weekly commitments?</p>

<ul>
<li>what must get done, NO MATTER WHAT, to solidify a successful week?</li>
<li>if you look back and got these things done, it&#39;d be a success.</li>
<li>u make sure they are intentional and strategic, tied to the big 5</li>
<li>u need to sell urself on why these commitments are important, or else u wont schedule and commit to it</li>
<li>profit producing activities

<ul>
<li>what 20-40% of your activities account for 60-80% of ur income</li>
<li>the 3 or 4 things that had to happen weekly to make sure the business was moving forward</li>
<li>results must be created whether u feel liek it or not</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>what are your non-negotiables?</p>

<ul>
<li>what habits or commitments you MUST do

<ul>
<li>consistently adding value</li>
<li>waking up early</li>
<li>working out 5 days a week</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>who do i need to reach out to this week?</p>

<ul>
<li>WHO should u reach out to that can help u get there quicker

<ul>
<li>elevate my thinking, results, maybe partner with, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Seize each day</h2>

<ul>
<li>if you take care of ur days, ur weeks take care of themselves</li>
<li><p>u dont set out to build a wall, you try to lay a brick as perfectly as a brick can be layed</p></li>
<li><p>focus the first hour of ur day in making urself STRONG (mentally, everything)</p>

<ul>
<li>what are the 3 things i have to do to ensure I WIN the day</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Stay intentional</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>minimize distractions and interruptions

<ul>
<li>what&#39;s distracting me the most</li>
<li>CREATE A PLAN to take care of these interruptions and distractions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Success orientation</li>
</ol>

<p>Unshakable Mindset
- you have to have a genuine confident belief that you could do anything you put your mind to
- find ways to maximize whatever resources u have</p>

<ol>
<li>Support structure</li>
</ol>

<p>Create a make it or break it list
- who are your 5 growth friends, and who are your maintenance friends</p>

<p>Hang around smart people
- a HUGE difference</p>

<h1>2nd Podcast: 6 months to 6 figures</h1>

<p>It&#39;s delaying my purpose. I am meant to impact and empower people. I cannot delay my true calling.</p>

<p>Your back has to be against the wall before you are clear on what you wanted.</p>

<h1>Shift your circle of influence</h1>

<p>If you want to be a millionaire, talk to a billionaire, you&#39;ll get there quicker.
- he reached out to the top 5 people in his company
- made a list of those who hold him to a higher standard and lifting him
- made a list who was letting him off the hook</p>

<ul>
<li>did not talk to those who were getting okay results</li>
<li>ask intelligent questions</li>
</ul>

<h2>- be fearless in reaching out to people</h2>

<p>visualize with </p>

<h1>Increase your confidence</h1>

<p>most people start off with a lot of excitement and then fluctuate until they fail</p>

<p>those who do what they &quot;feel like&quot; don&#39;t do much</p>

<p>I define my result rituals
- i figure out what results I needed to happen</p>

<ul>
<li>results come from habits, so put your habits </li>
<li>inspiration is short term</li>
<li><p>habits are long term</p></li>
<li><p>interrupt bad thought patterns</p></li>
<li><p>never listened to the news</p></li>
<li><p>only listened to successful people that u want to become</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;congruent to your goals&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>continual growth and learning</p></li>
</ul>

<p>!!!!### place people around you that won&#39;t let u get complacent</p>

<ul>
<li>what am i excited about</li>
<li>what am I grateful for</li>
<li>what am I committed to making happen today no matter what</li>
</ul>

<p>BEWARE OF THIS ------&gt; lack of momentum BEWARE</p>

<ul>
<li>REACH OUT to people at a higher level</li>
</ul>
