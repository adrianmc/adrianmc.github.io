  <h1 class="post-title">What I learned from Seth Godin's Startup School</h1>
  <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2015</span>
  <p>I recently finished listening to <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/startup-school/">Seth Godin&#39;s Startup School</a> podcasts and took notes on the content. Below is the condensed form of what I personally extracted from all 15 episodes.</p>

<h1>Episode 1: Freelancer or Entrepreneur?</h1>

<h2>3 things you need to be good at</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you know what to do?</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you understand, from 10,000 feet, what the smartest people in the industry would tell you is the right thing to do?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Are you able to do it? </p>

<ul>
<li>Are you capable enough to do the right thing (the thing you need to do)?</li>
<li>Organizing, marketing, hiring, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do you care enough about the project to get hit?</p>

<ul>
<li>How invested are you into the project?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Lessons from Monopoly</h2>

<p><strong>Every successful business has a monopoly</strong> - Figure out what it is that you can do, that will cause people to go out of their way to come to you for it. The current entrepreneurial environment is that of a connection economy. Be at the centre of connections, because it is more important than simply selling stuff. If your friends are using a networked product (like Facebook for example), you won&#39;t go to another product even if it may be better. Clearly, it&#39;s not enough to be better, that is the old industrial economy.</p>

<h2>An Entrepreneur</h2>

<p>An entrepreneur builds something bigger than himself. When you&#39;re a bootstrapper, you have to start by yourself, but eventually you must ask: How do I make it so the people I hire are better at their tasks than I am?</p>

<p>People give you money because they think what you are doing is worth more than it costs. So you as the entrepreneur has the obligation to deliver on that value, or else you won&#39;t have any customers. Therefore, marketing is just telling a story about the value that you can provide that can resonate with people enough that they will give you money.</p>

<p>You must figure out:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do you tell the story?</li>
<li>Who do you tell the story to?</li>
<li>How do you create this value?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Episode 2: Adjusting the Course</h1>

<p>The hard part is not defining the path, but it&#39;s sticking to the path. It is a very scary and lonely path, especially because a lot of the people around you won&#39;t be able to talk to you about it.</p>

<p>Real entrepreneurship: if the geniuses took two weeks off, will the business keep running?</p>

<p>You can be the smartest person in the world, but if the voice in your head pushes you to avoid opportunities, you won&#39;t get ahead.</p>

<h2>Questions to ask about your business</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> - Nothing is for everyone, you need to define your market.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What do they believe?</strong> - What are the different world views of the people you are targetting? There will be sub-groups of the groups that you have defined in the first question above. What is the story they are telling themselves?</p>

<ul>
<li>How do they view the world?</li>
<li>How would they view your particular product or service?</li>
<li>How would they respond to the way you market?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Have they ever spent cash money to buy something like this before?</strong> - It is a lot more difficult to sell to people who are not already spending money on a similar product or service. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does this group or sub-group know about you?</strong> - There&#39;s a huge gulf between people who ahve heard of you and those who are not aware of you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those people who are aware of you, do they trust you?</strong> - There&#39;s a big gap between those who are simply aware of you and those who trust you enough to buy from you.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>B2B is the same as B2C except that B2B is asking the question: Will this make my boss happy?</p>

<p>In the connection economy, we have to think about the value your business creates.</p>

<h2>3 Kinds of Revenue</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cash</li>
<li>Attention and trust</li>
<li>Referral</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Episode 3: Creating Scarcity</h1>

<p>Would I buy your product or hire your service to solve my problem?</p>

<p>Difference between manipulation and marketing is that with manipulation, you will regret buying it later. But with marketing, you&#39;ll still be glad you bought it.</p>

<p>The app market is a sucker&#39;s game:</p>

<ul>
<li>biggest haystack, and you&#39;re the tiniest needle</li>
<li>most apps don&#39;t lend themselves to network effects and scale</li>
<li>it is difficult to sell your app before people try</li>
</ul>

<p>Good network effect
&quot;It works better if my friends used it too&quot;</p>

<p>What problem is my customer waking up with?</p>

<p>Your job is not to find more customers for your product, your job is to find more product for your customers. What other tools are available to these customers so that I can use their connections to develop more value.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the hard part of your business? If there is no hard part, then it&#39;s not going to be a successful business.</p>

<p>All the time being spent on your logo is just you avoiding doing the hard things.</p>

<p>As this thing catches on, does it become more valuable or less valuable?</p>

<p>Tribe targetting. You must DEFINE the tribe. Not just simple demographics, but maybe they&#39;re all reading the same magazine, or are fans of the same type of thing.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Episode 4: Appealing to Consumers</h1>

<p>Are you selling a product that will appeal to:
- early adopters?
- the masses?
- people who won&#39;t buy unless they need it</p>

<p>You have to cross the chasm from the early adopters to the masses</p>

<p>In the beginning, look for tribal watering holes where early adopters hang out at. Make them the &quot;insiders&quot;. Make it the perfect product for that small group. Eventually, you might cross the chasm through this community.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to skip the tribe leaders.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t decide on an idea? Think about deciding on lunch.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Episode 5: Permission and Trust</h1>

<p>When you start, figure out how you can get from the tribe to the masses.</p>

<p>Make sure you don&#39;t insist on sticking to a path that is a wrong path. You need to keep experimenting and keep changing things that are not working. Do not fall in love with a vision in your head. The more degrees of freedom you have, the more likely you will have a business that works.</p>

<p>Blogging/Content marketing: Commit to writing something for your tribe everyday. Not about yourself.</p>

<p>It will never be perfect and proven, so stop thinking of all that before you start doing.</p>

<p>Can you build something that will be missed if it was gone.</p>

<h2>Struggling w/ Costs</h2>

<p>What assumptions have you made about what you need (that you can actually skip)?
Can I do it faster?
Start with the people who value what you can do instead of trying to pretend to be someone else.</p>

<p>You do NOT need to launch pretty. </p>

<p>Build trust.</p>

<p>What are people paying for, and can I dramatically provide something with a higher value for the same price?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Episode 6: Raising Money</h1>

<p>How to get rid of the work you are using to distract yourself, as opposed to the stuff that is actually difficult and needs to be done.</p>

<p>What&#39;s scarce, what&#39;s hard.</p>
