<h1>Review</h1>

<p>Goal: From Wantrepreneur to Entrepreneur</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>Avoid
- Sexy ideas
- Asking for opinions on your ideas
- Making assumptions</p>

<p>Let people <em>vote with their wallets</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Things may come to those who wait ... but only things left by those who hustle&quot;</p>

<p>3 Core Things:
1. idea
2. execution
3. hustle</p>

<p>Medium term goal: execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world</p>

<p>Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time.</p>

<p>*Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers </p>

<p>Hustle = Getting Customers (through any way possible)</p>

<p>AFTER LAUNCH: you need to get more people paying you. You have to relentlessly pursue your best method of getting customers, and not the stuff you naturally gravitate to.
- GETTING MORE CUSTOMERS</p>

<p>DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO ASSUME THINGS - LAUNCH FIRST AND DECIDE BASED ON REAL CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR
- learn from real data</p>

<p>Validation does not work when the answer is not a definite yes (if not fuck yes, than no)</p>

<p>People don&#39;t know what they <em>don&#39;t</em> want until they are forced to open their wallets.</p>

<p>BEWARE OF HAVING TOO MUCH TIME - you will be inefficient
&quot;If you are a long way out, you make up tasks that you think are important.&quot;</p>

<h2>7 Day Schedule</h2>

<p>Day 1: Idea
Day 2: Have something to launch
Day 3: Name
Day 4: Landing page
Day 5: Getting in front of people
Day 6: Measuring success
Day 7: Launch</p>

<p>Email him your progress</p>

<h3>Day 1 - The Idea</h3>

<p>9 Elements of a Bootstrapped Business Idea
1. Enjoyable daily tasks
2. Product/founder fit
- your skills
- what you&#39;re known for
- where you can provide the most value
3. Scalable business model
4. Operates profitably without the founder
5. An asset you can sell
- think about what you can build as a long term asset
- site traffic is great, but a large e-mail list is much better
6. Large market potential
7. Tap into pain or pleasure differentiators
8. Unique lead generation advantage
- think about how you will generate leads
- what will make you and your company unique?
9. Ability to launch quickly
- choose an idea that you can launch and modify quickly</p>

<p>DO NOT PICK LOW-HANGING FRUIT</p>

<p>Creation must happen EVERY DAY</p>

<p>Solve problems where people are ALREADY paying for solutions.
- relieve pain points without cultivating new behaviours from customers
- ask the question: Are people already paying for a solution to the same problem</p>

<p>Actionable Steps:
- Brainstorm a bunch of ideas
- Evaluate them against the 9 element checklist </p>

<h3>Day 2 - The MVP</h3>

<p>Do not over-minimize and under-viablize (Big M, small V, MVP).</p>

<ul>
<li>do not put out an MVP that is much worse than current products</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:
1. put up screenshots, explain the product
2. client pays, make them do a few actions (for data collection purposes)
3. tell them their product will be ready soon
4. call and talk them through what&#39;s being done; give them the product</p>

<p>Forget about automating everything, figure out what you can do manually now to launch within a week.</p>

<p>DO NOT worry about how ugly or painful it looks on our end, what matters is that you can DELIVER ON CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS.
- mimic the customer experience as quickly as possible</p>

<p>Focus ONLY on what you need to do to make the MVP something ppl would pay for
- just PROVE that ppl would pay for it</p>

<p>DO NOT DO FREE VERSIONS</p>

<p>Chapter Sumamry
- How can you perform a servie or offer a product to real customers?
- How will you get them to pay you after 7 days?
- How close will your MVP be to the final vision of your product?
- What can you do manually (hint: probably everything)?
- What can you do yourself instead of delegating?
- How can you make your offer as real as possible for the end customer?</p>

<p>Actionable Steps:
- Write down what you will launch on day 7
- What will your customers get?
    - What is included?
    - What is excluded?
- What will be automated?
- What will be manually done (in the short term)?</p>

<h3>Day 3 - The Name</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t overthink it, we are going for an &quot;acceptable&quot; name. Just come up with 10 names that aren&#39;t ridiculous.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it taken?</li>
<li>Is it simple?</li>
<li>don&#39;t make up words</li>
<li>don&#39;t misspell words</li>
<li>fewer than 12 characters</li>
<li>Is it easy to say out loud?</li>
<li>Do you like it?</li>
<li>Does it make sense for your idea (this is a bonus)?</li>
<li>Broader is better.</li>
</ol>

<p>Actionable Steps:
- Generate 10 names
- Go through the checklist</p>

<h3>Day 4 - Build the site (in one day for less than $100)</h3>

<p>3 Options:
1. Create a site to capture e-mails before you launch in 4 days time
2. Create a site that pre-sells your product before you launch it
3. Create the actual sales page you will use on launch day</p>

<p>Day 7 = MUST HAVE A PAY BUTTON</p>

<h3>Day 5 - Marketing</h3>

<h4>Content Marketing</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re searching for something, then other people probably are as well. Scratching your own itch may not work for business ideas, but it can work for developing a marketing plan. Find a gap in what you are searching for and produce detailed blog posts devoted to those topics.</p>

<p>topic ideas
- in-depth content based around customer problems that your solution solves
- make actionable and useful content to your target
- make sure it&#39;s interesting to the audience
- catch e-mails
- don&#39;t worry about SEO, focus on valuable content
- try different mediums
    - blog post
    - infographic 
    - video
    - podcasts
    - ebooks 
    - whitepapers
    - etc.</p>

<p>create LOTS of content
consider doing guest posts and interviews on other people&#39;s blogs</p>

<h4>Start Sending Emails</h4>

<ul>
<li>build a list BEFORE launch</li>
</ul>

<p>Building a List
1. add people you already know early on
2. have a landing page
3. send out high quality relevant information
4. GIVE away something relevant and valuable to get people on the list
    - software
    - plugins
    - templates
    - ebooks
    - training courses
    - etc.
5. create good blog posts and create content relevant to the post that you can give away
    - even if it&#39;s something kind of trivial
    - the fact that it might be a simple template doesn&#39;t matter
    - it makes it look like you&#39;re offering tons of value
    - people might just download it to see what it is, and by then they&#39;re already subconsciously more involved
6. Keep your emails personal and ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPLY
    - get feedback
    - build goodwill</p>

<li>sent your own best articles to other sites</li>
</ol>

<h4>Chapter Conclusion</h4>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s just about &quot;getting your message out to qualified people as efficiently as possible&quot;. Do it in a way that utilizes your unique strengths and gets you customers.</p>

<p>Action: Put together a rough plan for the first week or two of launch.</p>

<h3>Day 6 - Set Targets</h3>

<p>How do we know if we&#39;ve failed or not? Rampant success and immediate flops are obvious, but what do we do with everything in between?</p>

<p>Focus on the One Metric That Matters (&quot;OMTM&quot;) at different stages of the business.</p>

<p>During launch, focus on the number of people who signup and pay. Set a reasonable number that takes into consideration your reach, the marketing efforts, and price point.</p>

<p>Overly aggressive targets can demotivate you. Shoot for a few customers early on and a realistic monthly growth rate.</p>

<p>WP Curve Example:
- 10 customers in the first month (or $500 in monthly recurring revenue)
- 10% per month for at least six months</p>

<p>MRR has always been the metric of choice</p>

<p>The OMTM can change over time</p>

<p>OMTM Gauge:
- see book for chart (location 1213 of 1697)
- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT</p>
