    <p>A while back, I found <a href="http://moz.com/blog/how-to-provide-unique-value-in-your-content-whiteboard-friday">this video</a> from <a href="http://moz.com/blog/how-to-provide-unique-value-in-your-content-whiteboard-friday">DigitalPoint.com</a>, an industry news site about business software. The number one rule of business (as I have recognized) is to create value. But how do you know if you&#39;re creating something valuable? Well this video seemed to explain just that. The video focuses on SEO, but the value of the content here is much more than that.</p>

        Book Summary: The 7 Day Startup

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2015</span>

    <p>I first heard about this book from this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2rz8aj/here_is_how_i_built_my_first_mvp_in_less_than_a/">Reddit post</a>. After Googling the book title, I found out that the theme of the book was to teach you to finally stop being a wantrepreneur and start executing on something. The story of the author, Dan Norris, is that he spent a year developing a startup which didn&#39;t really go anywhere, and was actually going to have to look for a job because he was running out of money. However, with just a couple weeks left, he cranked out a wildly successful business by launching in 7 days. I thought this was very intriguing, so I bought it and gave it a read. Below are the major ideas I&#39;ve been able to extract from this book.</p>

    <p>This is the story of how I will attempt to start a profitable online business in a year and a half. I have an employment contract that will end in June of 2016 and that&#39;s why I am on such a tight deadline. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve always believed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson&#39;s Law</a>.</p>
