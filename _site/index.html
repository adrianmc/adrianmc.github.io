    <p>It&#39;s that time again. I&#39;ve learned a lot more since the last time I posted code-snippets. A lot of these were small issues where the solution was not immediately obvious and took a non-insiginificant amount of time for me to find it. Amongst them, I&#39;ve also included a few references that I think are useful resources.</p>

    <p>This is the first of my <a href="/2015/01/14/the-beginning/">28-day evaluations</a>. In the last 28 days I’ve surprised myself with how much I had gotten done. But it wasn’t all accomplishments either, there were a lot of things that I have learned that I wouldn’t have learned if I didn’t have to struggle through them.</p>

        Lessons from Peter Voogd

    <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2015</span>

    <p>Peter Voogd is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/6-Months-Figures-Peter-Voogd-ebook/dp/B00QJITFC6">6 Months to 6 Figures</a>, a book which I have not yet read but plan to do so in the future. I&#39;ve been listening to some podcasts from Hal Elrod of <a href="http://themiraclemorning.com">The Miracle Morning</a>, and today I&#39;m going to summarize a couple of episodes where Peter Voogd was featured. Below is a summary of the ideas I&#39;ve learned from both of these episodes. They overlap a bit, so I just merged my notes into one. </p>

        7 lessons from my first app failure
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>

    <p>In the summer of 2013, I had the idea to make a mobile app, so I called up one of my friends and got to work. Over a year later, we launched <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aheadstudios.talkalytics">Texty Time</a>. The project took so long and not too many people used it, so I decided I never wanted to touch or even think about it again. Recently, I was reading <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a>&#39;s blog on how he planned to start <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/">12 startups in 12 months</a>. For a lot of these projects, he had a project debrief page where he talks about what he learned from each of them. Suddenly, I realized that I myself have attemped (and failed) at making something akin to a &quot;startup&quot; as well (albeit very very humble and basic). This is the story of what I learned.</p>

    <p>I learn a lot while building things, and I don&#39;t want to forget what I&#39;ve learned. It has happened many times in the past, so this time I have decided to keep a record of what I have learned so that I won&#39;t have to redo any research that I&#39;ve already done. Hopefully, this will be useful to other people as well.</p>
