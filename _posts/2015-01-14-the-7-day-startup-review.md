title: Book Review: The 7 Day Startup
---

# Review

Goal: From Wantrepreneur to Entrepreneur

# Notes

Avoid
- Sexy ideas
- Asking for opinions on your ideas
- Making assumptions

Let people *vote with their wallets*.

"Things may come to those who wait ... but only things left by those who hustle"

3 Core Things:
1. idea
2. execution
3. hustle

Medium term goal: execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world

Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time.

*Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers 

Hustle = Getting Customers (through any way possible)

AFTER LAUNCH: you need to get more people paying you. You have to relentlessly pursue your best method of getting customers, and not the stuff you naturally gravitate to.
- GETTING MORE CUSTOMERS

DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO ASSUME THINGS - LAUNCH FIRST AND DECIDE BASED ON REAL CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR
- learn from real data

Validation does not work when the answer is not a definite yes (if not fuck yes, than no)

People don't know what they *don't* want until they are forced to open their wallets.

BEWARE OF HAVING TOO MUCH TIME - you will be inefficient
"If you are a long way out, you make up tasks that you think are important."

## 7 Day Schedule
Day 1: Idea
Day 2: Have something to launch
Day 3: Name
Day 4: Landing page
Day 5: Getting in front of people
Day 6: Measuring success
Day 7: Launch

Email him your progress

### Day 1 - The Idea

9 Elements of a Bootstrapped Business Idea
1. Enjoyable daily tasks
2. Product/founder fit
- your skills
- what you're known for
- where you can provide the most value
3. Scalable business model
4. Operates profitably without the founder
5. An asset you can sell
- think about what you can build as a long term asset
- site traffic is great, but a large e-mail list is much better
6. Large market potential
7. Tap into pain or pleasure differentiators
8. Unique lead generation advantage
- think about how you will generate leads
- what will make you and your company unique?
9. Ability to launch quickly
- choose an idea that you can launch and modify quickly

DO NOT PICK LOW-HANGING FRUIT

Creation must happen EVERY DAY


Solve problems where people are ALREADY paying for solutions.
- relieve pain points without cultivating new behaviours from customers
- ask the question: Are people already paying for a solution to the same problem

Actionable Steps:
- Brainstorm a bunch of ideas
- Evaluate them against the 9 element checklist 

### Day 2 - The MVP

Do not over-minimize and under-viablize (Big M, small V, MVP).

- do not put out an MVP that is much worse than current products

Example:
1. put up screenshots, explain the product
2. client pays, make them do a few actions (for data collection purposes)
3. tell them their product will be ready soon
4. call and talk them through what's being done; give them the product

Forget about automating everything, figure out what you can do manually now to launch within a week.

DO NOT worry about how ugly or painful it looks on our end, what matters is that you can DELIVER ON CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS.
- mimic the customer experience as quickly as possible

Focus ONLY on what you need to do to make the MVP something ppl would pay for
- just PROVE that ppl would pay for it

DO NOT DO FREE VERSIONS

Chapter Sumamry
- How can you perform a servie or offer a product to real customers?
- How will you get them to pay you after 7 days?
- How close will your MVP be to the final vision of your product?
- What can you do manually (hint: probably everything)?
- What can you do yourself instead of delegating?
- How can you make your offer as real as possible for the end customer?

Actionable Steps:
- Write down what you will launch on day 7
- What will your customers get?
	- What is included?
	- What is excluded?
- What will be automated?
- What will be manually done (in the short term)?

### Day 3 - The Name

Don't overthink it, we are going for an "acceptable" name. Just come up with 10 names that aren't ridiculous.

1. Is it taken?
2. Is it simple?
- don't make up words
- don't misspell words
- fewer than 12 characters
3. Is it easy to say out loud?
4. Do you like it?
5. Does it make sense for your idea (this is a bonus)?
6. Broader is better.

Actionable Steps:
- Generate 10 names
- Go through the checklist

### Day 4 - Build the site (in one day for less than $100)

3 Options:
1. Create a site to capture e-mails before you launch in 4 days time
2. Create a site that pre-sells your product before you launch it
3. Create the actual sales page you will use on launch day

Day 7 = MUST HAVE A PAY BUTTON

### Day 5 - Marketing

#### Content Marketing

If you're searching for something, then other people probably are as well. Scratching your own itch may not work for business ideas, but it can work for developing a marketing plan. Find a gap in what you are searching for and produce detailed blog posts devoted to those topics.

topic ideas
- in-depth content based around customer problems that your solution solves
- make actionable and useful content to your target
- make sure it's interesting to the audience
- catch e-mails
- don't worry about SEO, focus on valuable content
- try different mediums
	- blog post
	- infographic 
	- video
	- podcasts
	- ebooks 
	- whitepapers
	- etc.

create LOTS of content
consider doing guest posts and interviews on other people's blogs

#### Start Sending Emails

- build a list BEFORE launch

Building a List
1. add people you already know early on
2. have a landing page
3. send out high quality relevant information
4. GIVE away something relevant and valuable to get people on the list
	- software
	- plugins
	- templates
	- ebooks
	- training courses
	- etc.
5. create good blog posts and create content relevant to the post that you can give away
	- even if it's something kind of trivial
	- the fact that it might be a simple template doesn't matter
	- it makes it look like you're offering tons of value
	- people might just download it to see what it is, and by then they're already subconsciously more involved
6. Keep your emails personal and ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPLY
	- get feedback
	- build goodwill

#### Podcasting

see guide (link in book)

#### Forums and Online Groups

join a forum, be an active member, build trust

check out Dynamitecircle.com

consider joining a paid group in your niche

#### Guest Blogging

Consider doing a guest post for an industry you quit, because your story is relevant to them

#### Listing Sites

add to AlternativeTo.net

Every industry have sites that list businesses in different ways.
- refer to book
- google around

#### Webinars

John Dumas' strategy
- build up a large audience
- gave away an eBook as a freebie, got your e-mail, then told you about a free webinar
- the webinars were super helpful
- for those who are interested in more info, he has a special deal for membership in the community

#### Presenting

local, in-person events

#### Doing Free Work

Reach out and do things for free.

#### Media Coverage

1. pull lists of relevant journalists to contact
2. chased down other entrepreneurs, and see who covered them
3. paid attention to parts of our own business that could be newsworthy and looked for STORIES
4. drop everything to be featured in the media
5. talk about yourselves all the time, be transparent
6. sent your own best articles to other sites

#### Chapter Conclusion

At the end of the day, it's just about "getting your message out to qualified people as efficiently as possible". Do it in a way that utilizes your unique strengths and gets you customers.

Action: Put together a rough plan for the first week or two of launch.

### Day 6 - Set Targets

How do we know if we've failed or not? Rampant success and immediate flops are obvious, but what do we do with everything in between?

Focus on the One Metric That Matters ("OMTM") at different stages of the business.

During launch, focus on the number of people who signup and pay. Set a reasonable number that takes into consideration your reach, the marketing efforts, and price point.

Overly aggressive targets can demotivate you. Shoot for a few customers early on and a realistic monthly growth rate.

WP Curve Example:
- 10 customers in the first month (or $500 in monthly recurring revenue)
- 10% per month for at least six months

MRR has always been the metric of choice

The OMTM can change over time

OMTM Gauge:
- see book for chart (location 1213 of 1697)
- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
