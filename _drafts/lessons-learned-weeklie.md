This year I made it a goal for me to do rapid development of websites. The idea is to try whatever comes to my mind as fast as possible so I could learn how to make good websites that will eventually drive revenue. I [wrote](http://adrianmcli.com/2015/01/28/28-day-evaluation/) about the [first website](http://b4yougo.net) before. This post is about [Weeklie](http://weeklie.com), which was my second website in this experiment of mine.

## The Origin

The concept for Weeklie began as I did my daily journaling in a blogspot blog. I wanted to build a habit of daily journaling and weekly evaluations so that I could find out how I was doing and where I could improve. I think this type of self-reflection and planning is essential to maximizing productivity.

As I was using blogspot for this purpose, I would often forget about what my weekly goals were. So I would copy and paste the weekly goals at the top of every daily post just so I could keep my goals in sight. After a while, this felt pretty tedious and I thought to myself, what if there was a way to put these weekly goals automatically at the top of every daily entry? And then Weeklie was born.

## The First Attempt

I had to get through learning how to implement Accounts
- required tweaking packages and contributing to open source code
