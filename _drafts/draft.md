This August, I'm expected to begin articling at a large firm that I summered at last year. And of course, I'm also expected to be studying for the bar in around May and June. However, I've found my life passion and a silicon valley startup has offered to take me on. With 100% certainty, I would not miss the legal profession at all, I was absolutely miserable during the summer months. How do I go about approaching the firm about this? What consequences are there?
