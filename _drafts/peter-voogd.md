title: "Lessons from Peter Voogd"
---

I've been listening to some podcasts, and today I'm going to summarize a couple of them that I found to be particularly valuable. Peter Voogd has went on Hal Elrod's podcasts twice, and I listened to both of them.

The links to the podcasts are here: [first](http://halelrod.com/36/), [second](http://halelrod.com/55-6-figures/).

# 1st Podcast: How to be a game changer

HOW FAST CAN I IMPLEMENT THIS - this is very important


Start by asking about your ideal outcome:
- What is your vision for business, lifestyle, income in 6-12 months?

# 1. Simplicity

Simplify what really matters to you.

## One-page productivity plan - mastery over information overload
- contents
	- one paragraph vision statement
		- who I am, where I wanna be, etc.
	- top values
		- flexibility, financial freedom, wealth, family, adventure
	- big 5 goals for the year
		- look at them and make sure they are in line with your values and they excite u
	- key behaviour and habits required to accomplish the big 5

- once u know what's important to you (see above), make sure the information you are studying is congruent to that
- master 3 books than read 50
	- it's not a race to finish a book
	- we want to see results in our lives and business
- focus on mastering a certain topic rather than simply focusing on finishing a book

Let your vision guide you, not your current circumstances, emotions, feelings, challenges.

## 2. Schedule everything - weekly review
- our memory sucks
- everything I want to accomplish for this week MUST be on paper
	- what did I get done and complete last week? pause and reflect.
		- what did i complete
		- what went well, what didn't go so well
		- when did i waste time, when was i at my best
		- REVIEWING IS SO IMPORTANT
	- what are your weekly commitments?
		- what must get done, NO MATTER WHAT, to solidify a successful week?
		- if you look back and got these things done, it'd be a success.
		- u make sure they are intentional and strategic, tied to the big 5
		- u need to sell urself on why these commitments are important, or else u wont schedule and commit to it
		
		- profit producing activities
			- what 20-40% of your activities account for 60-80% of ur income
			- the 3 or 4 things that had to happen weekly to make sure the business was moving forward
			- results must be created whether u feel liek it or not

	- what are your non-negotiables?
		- what habits or commitments you MUST do
			- consistently adding value
			- waking up early
			- working out 5 days a week

	- who do i need to reach out to this week?
		- WHO should u reach out to that can help u get there quicker
			- elevate my thinking, results, maybe partner with, etc.

## 3. Seize each day
- if you take care of ur days, ur weeks take care of themselves
- u dont set out to build a wall, you try to lay a brick as perfectly as a brick can be layed

- focus the first hour of ur day in making urself STRONG (mentally, everything)
	- what are the 3 things i have to do to ensure I WIN the day

4. Stay intentional

- minimize distractions and interruptions
	- what's distracting me the most
	- CREATE A PLAN to take care of these interruptions and distractions

5. Success orientation

Unshakable Mindset
- you have to have a genuine confident belief that you could do anything you put your mind to
- find ways to maximize whatever resources u have

6. Support structure

Create a make it or break it list
- who are your 5 growth friends, and who are your maintenance friends

Hang around smart people
- a HUGE difference

# 2nd Podcast: 6 months to 6 figures

It's delaying my purpose. I am meant to impact and empower people. I cannot delay my true calling.

Your back has to be against the wall before you are clear on what you wanted.

# Shift your circle of influence

If you want to be a millionaire, talk to a billionaire, you'll get there quicker.
- he reached out to the top 5 people in his company
- made a list of those who hold him to a higher standard and lifting him
- made a list who was letting him off the hook

- did not talk to those who were getting okay results
- ask intelligent questions
- be fearless in reaching out to people
- 

visualize with 

# Increase your confidence

most people start off with a lot of excitement and then fluctuate until they fail

those who do what they "feel like" don't do much

I define my result rituals
- i figure out what results I needed to happen

- results come from habits, so put your habits 
- inspiration is short term
- habits are long term

- interrupt bad thought patterns

- never listened to the news
- only listened to successful people that u want to become
	- "congruent to your goals"

- continual growth and learning

!!!!### place people around you that won't let u get complacent

- what am i excited about
- what am I grateful for
- what am I committed to making happen today no matter what

BEWARE OF THIS ------> lack of momentum BEWARE

- REACH OUT to people at a higher level
