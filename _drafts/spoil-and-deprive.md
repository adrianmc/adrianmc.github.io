title: "Spoil and Deprive"
---

Only those who have their backs against the wall can truly find out what they really want and what they will sacrifice to get there. This is the compliment to my spoil and deprive idea. We have to feel desperate to succeed, or else we never will. How do you make yourself desperate?

It's not smart to simply dump all your money into the trash and live in a cardboard box. It will hamper your effectiveness. There is an alternate way to create desperation within yourself, and that is the spoil and deprive cycle.

We're all familiar with the hedonic treadmill. Well, we want to get to the rear edge of the treadmill and feel like we're about to fall off. But we don't actually want to fall off (e.g. bankruptcy or damaging your health and safety). We can actually USE the hedonic treadmill to our advantage in this case. By spoiling ourselves and forcing ourselves to experience luxuries, we inexorably will FEEL like we are at the back of the treadmill when our life goes back to "normal".

tl;dr - Spoil and deprive simulates the desperation required for incredible drive and willpower.
