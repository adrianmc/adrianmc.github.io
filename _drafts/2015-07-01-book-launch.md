How to write, market, and self-publish your first bestseller in 3 months or less and use it to start and grow a six figure business. Well, at least that's the tagline under the book title. Chandler is a guy who initially put up a 20-page eBook on Amazon with a friend and accidentally (or not so accidentally) found himself as a bestselling author in the productivity category. This book promises to show how you can do it too.

I'll be summarizing key actionable points I've learned from this book so I can easily refer to them in the future. My hope is that this will be useful to you as well.

## Notes

An unrealistic launch date is required to get the book out into the world.

> The most effective books are ones that show stories of transformation:

> - Why you do what you do
> - How you've used your system to help others
> - How it made you and them feel

> The more personal touch you give it, the better people will connect with your message.

> There’s also a lot to be said about consolidating the best information, which is what we did with The Productive Person. We took the best information out there, added our new discoveries, and put it in one place that was easy for people to access.

> We knew that it would add value to everyone who read it (even though it wasn’t 100% unique/original material).

> Instead of a writer, think of yourself as a storyteller.

> “Writing fast means being more focused.”

> On a deeper level, it was even more life-changing because, for a lot of people, they’ve been frustrated all they’re lives but didn’t know how to take the first step to become financially free.
Writing a book is a stepping-stone. Maybe you want to be a public speaker, a coach, or an entrepreneur. Writing a book is THE FIRST STEP toward making that happen.
Even deeper, writing a book boosts your confidence. If you’ve been failing over and over again in your attempts to create something for yourself, you start to think that you’re the one that just sucks and everyone else has it figured out.

> When you get that success from actually finishing something (perhaps for the first time in a really long time) and seeing your book become a bestseller, your confidence grows.

3 Keys

1. Fail First, Then Learn

> A great real-world example of this first key is our mistake while editing The Productive Person, a total MVP (minimum viable product) book. We self-edited (read through the book twice) and just put it out there.
The book was a success, but our editing wasn’t great. However, we learned from that and hired an editor. Then published an updated version that continued to climb the charts.

> Just by taking action, whether it’s putting out a book, writing a chapter, or whatever that thing might be, it is probable that you are going to fail at some point. Don’t worry — you should welcome failure because that is when you will learn the most.

2. Accountability

3. Take Consistent Action

> This means you need to be consistent in your writing, marketing, and most importantly, time management.

----

> On the other hand, when my business partner James and I wrote The Productive Person, we were writing it for a specific group of people: entrepreneurs who wanted to be more productive with their workdays. This made the book easy to write because we knew our audience and wrote directly to that group.

Main reasons:

1. Build a reputation
2. Money and leads
3. Grow your network
4. Passion project

> Regardless of what your purpose for writing a book is, having a clear vision as to why will make your writing much clearer.

TODO - Take 15–30 minutes today to write about the reasons why YOU want to write a book.

## Generating a Book Idea

1. set aside at least 10 min of uninterrupted time
2. Write about what sparks your interest. Let your brain just make the association about what you love or care about the most.
3. Try one of the following prompts if stuck: “I am interested in ...” and “I would like to write about ...”

Do NOT stop writing, have no filter at all. Write about anything that comes to your mind.

I suggest that you head over to the Amazon Kindle store to browse the top books in categories that interest you.

If you *really* can't think of anything, these four categories always sell a lot:

- Diet and fitness
- Relationships or breakups
- Time management or stress management
- How to make more money

If you choose this route, be sure to keep the following in mind:

- notice common (popular) themes within the bestsellers
- never think that there will be no room for you (lots of bestsellers is a GOOD thing)
- a bestseller ranking lower than 20,000 is good
- use the 2-star and 3-star reviews of best sellers to find what is lacking and attack that

You'll still need to find an idea that:

- you can write about with passion
- can research in a weekend
- can fill a void in a missing niche

## Refining Your Idea

Drill down and make your idea more focused.

> This process will help validate your book idea, find the holes in the market, and position your book to meet the needs that are there. 

Steps:

1. goto the bestsellers section in the Kindle store, and look for similar titles or ideas
2. we need to find a pain-point
  - this might be a shorter book that is much needed in your category!
3. branch out to other categories to see if there may be a hole in the market
4. see what other successful authors are doing

## Lazy Author's Shortcut to Writing a Book

1. Mindmap
2. Outline
3. Write

### Pat Flynn's way of outlining is superior

Mindmap -> Group -> Sequence

Groups are the Parts

Each group can be split into Chapters
