- A vision statement for the next 6-12 months
	- About one paragraph long.
	- Who you want to be,
	- Where you want to be,
	- etc.

> At the end of the next 6 months, I would have launched at least 4 different websites. Revenue-wise, I would like to have generated at least $100. By that time, I want to be more fit than I am today and to have kept up my exercise regime such that my body will begin to look athletic. I also want to make sure I would have added two new people to my circle of influence.

- Five important core values
	- What's important to you?
	- "Your values make you do the things that are often not easy to do. You donâ€™t want to live life based on somebody else's values."
	- Examples: flexibility, financial freedom, wealth, family, adventure, impact, health, influence

> Financial freedom, impact, fitness, discipline, industry.

- Five big goals for the next 6-12 months
	- The 5 things you *need* to accomplish

1. Launched 4 websites
2. Added two people to my circle of influence
3. Generated $100 in revenue
4. Finished law school
5. Blogged every single day

- Five most compelling reasons to hit these goals
	- How your goals are in line with your values.
	- This should excite you about developing the havits to achieve the goals
		- By tying your goals with your values, you make achieving them to be part of who you are

1. Launching 4 websites will develop the discipline necessary to do great things
2. Expanding my circle of influence will accelerate my ability to achieve all 5 of my values
3. Setting a goal for something I never thought I would've been able to do allows me to see how far I could go
4. To finish what I start
5. To maintain good habits for the long term

- Three key behaviours you *must* develop
	- The habits and behaviour required to accomplish the big 5 goals above

- Wake up early every single day
- Exercise in the morning every single day
- Start each day with the intention to make it a successful day
