In the past, I've taught a good number of people how to program and make websites and I always encounter a similar problem. People seem to think that you have to be really smart or something in order to write programs. Fact of the matter is, I've come to the realization that I am a complete idiot and that has been the only real way I've been able to learn anything at all! Let's dive into this a little further.

I remember when I first tried learning to program at the tender age of 15. I recall thinking that this was something super complicated that someone like me probably wouldn't be able to understand. But then I chanced upon an online tutorial that was titled something like "learn X in 48 hours". And I said to myself, "wow, 48 hours? I have that. Let's give it a shot!"

And well, I did the tutorial and barely slept those few days. I knew that I wanted to get through it to see if the tutorial actually worked as advertised. But surprise! Surprise! 48 hours later (plus time spent sleeping/eating) I built a simple calculator in Visual Basic!

Crazy right?

Since then, everything I've done in the realm of computing is to first assume that I am an idiot.

There's a short anecdote in programming about three different programmers. I try to recall it from memory here:

> The difference between a beginner, intermediate, and expert programmer is as follows:

> The beginner has very little confidence in his code. He may take quite a long time, but he will eventually finish with a barely passable product that breaks often.

> The intermediate has a lot of confidence in his code, and he will have spent a long time documenting and making sure to follow the patterns recommended by best practices. His code works as expected and everyone is happy.

> The expert programmer solves the problem in half the time because he doesn't introduce complexity when there is no need for it. He knows the value of keeping things as simple as possible.

I believe in the same thing. The only way to really learn is to break big problems down into small ones, and recognize that you're going to have to take small or even tiny steps in order to get to your goal.

To see if anyone would be interested in what I want to say I've decided to spend about $15 (for a domain) and some time on this. This is the pre-launch of "How To Think Like an Idiot: The average person's guide to programming websites."
